Hi, this is a simple user api, able to register new user, edit user, view user and delete user depending on roles (admin / user). 
It is still work in progress (especially the test unit) and I will tidy up the source codes from time to time.

Technology used:
- JDK 17
- SpringBoot v3
- MyBatis v3
- Spring Security v6
- H2 Database v2
- JUnit v5
- Jacoco
- JsonWebToken
